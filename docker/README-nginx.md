# Serving Great Expectations Data Docs with nginx

This project includes a small docker-compose configuration that runs an `nginx` container
to serve the static Data Docs generated by Great Expectations.

How it works
- The compose file mounts the local Data Docs site directory into the nginx html root.
- The container exposes port `8080` on the host and serves the files read-only.

Usage

1. Generate or update Data Docs using the runtime (example):

```bash
python -m dq_docker.run_adls_checkpoint
```

2. Start the nginx container (from the repo root):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

Configuration
- nginx config: `docker/nginx/nginx.conf` (minimal; adjust as needed).
- compose file: `docker/docker-compose.yml` mounts `./gx/uncommitted/data_docs/local_site` into nginx. If your Data Docs directory differs, update the volume path accordingly.

Notes and tips
- This approach keeps the Data Docs hosting separate from the runtime: the runtime writes files into the repo, and nginx just serves the static output.
- For production use consider adding TLS termination, caching headers, or running nginx behind a reverse proxy/load balancer.
